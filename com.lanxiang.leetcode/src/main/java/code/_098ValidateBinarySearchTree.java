/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 * <p>
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * <p>
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 * Example 1:
 * 2
 * / \
 * 1   3
 * Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
 * Example 2:
 * 1
 * / \
 * 2   3
 * Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
